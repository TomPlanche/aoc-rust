# aoc-rust ðŸ¦€

> My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in Rust for learning purposes.

I'm using my [aoc-rust-cli](https://github.com/TomPlanche/aoc-cli) in order to generate the boilerplate for each day and help me compiling and running the code.

I'm not pushing the `data` folder because it contains the input data and instructions for each day. You can find them on the [official website](https://adventofcode.com/).
